Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Names** | **[]string** | A unique array of strings that together constitute the Identity&#39;s name. Each string should be in Base64 format.   *Note: It is best to avoid adding personally identifiable information to the blockchain.* | 
**Keys** | **[]string** | A list of public keys that will be used to verify this Indentyâ€™s signatures. You may initiate an identity with as many keys as you like. The array of keys should be sent in order of priority with 0 being the master key. The keys should be sent as Base58 strings in IdPub format. | 
**CallbackUrl** | **string** | The URL where you would like to receive the callback from Connect. If this is not specified, callbacks will not activate. | [optional]

This list can include any or all of the three stages: &#x60;replicated&#x60;, &#x60;factom&#x60;, and &#x60;anchored&#x60;. If callbacks are activated and this field is not sent, it will default to &#x60;factom&#x60; and &#x60;anchored&#x60; | [optional]
